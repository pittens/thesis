### Running the .IPYNB files

An IPYNB file is a notebook document. To run the code in these documents, the file must be loaded into a Jupyter Notebook environment. Because some calculations require a GPU, it is advisable to use the free and online Google Colab environment (https://colab.research.google.com/). 

### Data

The CoST data is automatically imported into the IPYNB 1_preprocessing file via a hyperlink. However, this was not possible for the HAART dataset. The data (download via http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spin/data) must be unzipped and placed into a 'data' folder.

### Installation

No further installations are required than those in the IPYNB file.
